The project satisfies all of the required tasks. In addition to the basic requirements, it also uses CoreData to persist the library books between uses.  This addition is used so that the app doesnâ€™t need to send a new API call each time the app opens.  Any update to the library via a network call also updates the managed object context.  This ensures that the data on the server and the data held in CoreData always match.  I added a refresh button on the OpeningViewController.  This button sends a new API GET request to the server and replaces the current data in the app.  I created this functionality so in the case that another user updates the library there is a way for the user to update their local data with out restarting the app.  

It uses MVC, Delegate and Singleton design patterns throughout.  I used 2 cocoa pods while creating app.  I used AlamoFire for the network requests and SwiftyJSON to help create and parse JSON data.   I used both Objective-C and Swift code.   I enjoyed making the app thank you for the opportunity.
